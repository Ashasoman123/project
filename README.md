Most of us have spent what seemed like forever in a retail store, waiting for the person in front of us in the queue to bill a large number of items, when we just needed a loaf of bread or a single shirt.  Long lines at the cashier counters can cause people to wait for a significant amount of time.  Our idea is to automate the check-out process, enabling automatic payment, striving towards a new-age digital shopping experience.We propose to do this by using a smart phone application that allows the user to scan the products he or she wishes to purchase, generate the bill for all the products scanned, make the payment and simply walk out of the store.   Instead of using traditional bar codes, we propose to use Quick Response (QR) codes to identify each product.  The application includes an option to search where a shop is located in the mall. The entire process of bill generation is automatically carried out, and is displayed on the interface as the user continues shopping.  Once all the items are scanned and the user confirms the purchase order, the final bill is generated and the user is be redirected to payment options. This application will help avoid long queues and provide a hassle free checkout.   It will not only reduce the amount of waiting time, but it will also reduce or eliminate the need for a cashier. In addition to this, in accordance to today’s trend of e-transactions, the entire process will be free of any hard cash.
